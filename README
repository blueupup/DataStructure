# Data Structures in C++

This project contains custom implementations of core data structures written in C++.  
The goal of this repository is to deepen understanding of internal algorithms, memory
management, and performance trade-offs behind commonly used structures.

#Features
This repository includes implementations of:

- **Linked List**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- **Hash Table** (Chaining or Open Addressing — depending on your implementation)
- **Graph Structures** (Adjacency List / Matrix)
- **Sorting Algorithms** (if included)

Each structure is implemented from scratch without relying on STL containers
(except where explicitly noted), focusing on learning fundamentals.

##Objectives
This project was built with the following goals:

- Strengthen understanding of **C++ memory management**  
- Learn low-level behavior of **pointers, dynamic allocation, and references**
- Explore **time and space complexity** of each data structure
- Demonstrate backend foundations relevant for systems and algorithmic roles
