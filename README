# Data Structures in C++

This project contains custom implementations of core data structures written in C++. The goal of this repository is to deepen understanding of internal algorithms, memory management, and performance trade-offs behind commonly used structures.

# Features
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Hash Table
- Graph Structures
- Sorting Algorithms (if included)

# Objectives
- Strengthen C++ memory management concepts
- Practice pointer, reference, and dynamic allocation fundamentals
- Explore time/space complexity
- Demonstrate backend foundations

# How to Compile & Run
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 main.cpp -o datastruct  
./datastruct

# Time Complexity (Overview)
Linked List Search: O(n)  
Stack Push/Pop: O(1)  
Queue Enqueue/Dequeue: O(1)  
BST Search: O(log n) average, O(n) worst  
Hash Table Insert: O(1) average  
Graph BFS/DFS: O(V+E)

# Future Improvements
- GoogleTest unit tests  
- AVL/Red-Black Tree  
- Graph algorithms  
- Benchmarks  
- More documentation
